# 100-Days-of-Python-Code
Day 1 to 100 Days of Python Coding

Day 1 Project 1

Step 1 Print Welcome Message:

print("Welcome to Band name Generator")  [This line prints the welcome message “Welcome to Band name Generator” to the console.

Step 2 Input City Name:

city = input("Enter your city ")  [The program prompts the user to enter the name of their city. The input is stored in the variable city.]

Step 3 Input Pet Name:

Pet = input("What's your pet name ")  [The program prompts the user to enter the name of their pet. The input is stored in the variable Pet.]

Step 4 Generate and Print Band Name:

print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + Pet)  [The program concatenates the strings "Your band name could be ", the value of city, a space, and the value of Pet. It then print                                                          the resulting string, which is the generated band name.]

                                                                  
Step 5 The Final Code for Project 1:
print("Welcome to Band name Generator")
city = input("Enter your city ")
Pet = input("What's your pet name ")
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + Pet)
